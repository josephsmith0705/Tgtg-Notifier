1. C++ Version
The program should use C++11

2. Header Files
Every .cpp file (with some exceptions, for example main.cpp) must have a header file, ending in .h
All header files should be self-contained, and use header guards, to ensure proper functionality

3. Scoping
Generally, global variables should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
Where possible, variables should be initialized in their declaration

4. Classes
Virtual functions should not be called from within a constructor
Implicit conversions should be avoided
Class definitions should follow the order public, protected and then private

5. Functions
Generally, functions should return values rather than perform output operations
Functions should be split up in order to ensure small size and therefore readability
To reduce confusion, avoid using trailing return types, and generally use the older method of specifying the return type of a function

6. Other C++ Features
Use preincrement and predecrement instead of postincrement and postdecrement
Other C++ extensions should only be used if necessary for the program, and not used to bypass proper coding practices

7. Naming
Use variable and function names that have a clear meaning
Variable and function names should be lowercase, and use uppercase characters to seperate words
File names should be all lowercase, and can use dashes
C++ files should have the .cpp extension, which header files use .h and ui files use .ui

8. Comments
Comments should only be used to ensure clarity and readability to code, and are not necessary where the code can be considered self-explanatory
Comments should use the // syntax
All functions, if not obvious at first glance, should have an accompanying comment describing the purpose of the function
Comments should have proper punctuation, spelling and grammar to ensure readability

9.Formatting
Non-ASCII characters should not be used
The tab key should be used for indentation, to ensure consistency
Function declarations and calls can be broken up onto multiple lines if too long to fit on one line
Conditional statements should be formatting with one space either side of the condition, outside the brackets
Variables and arrays should be initialized using =
Contents of private, protected and public in a class should be indented with one tab
Contents of namespace do not need to be indented
Horizontal whitespace should not be placed at the end of a line

Exceptions to these rules:
These rules should be followed wherever possible, unless it is absolutely necessary
